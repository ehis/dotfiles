  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

# Font configuration
font:
  # Normal (roman) font face
  normal:
    # Font family
    #
    # Default:
    #   - (macOS) Menlo
    #   - (Linux/BSD) monospace
    #   - (Windows) Consolas
    family: MonoLisa  

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Regular

  # Bold font face
  bold:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the bold family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    family: MonoLisa  

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Bold

  # Italic font face
  italic:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the italic family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    family: MonoLisa  

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Regular Italic

  # Bold italic font face
  bold_italic:

  # Point size
  size: 12.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 1
    y: 1

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.
  #glyph_offset:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command: #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  #use_thin_strokes: true

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
    draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: true
